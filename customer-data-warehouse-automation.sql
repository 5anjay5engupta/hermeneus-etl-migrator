**Explanation:**

1. **Transformation Logic**: The transformation logic from the WhereScape workflow is preserved using SQL transformations in dbt models. The `TRIM` and `UPPER` functions are applied directly in the `stg_customers` model.

2. **SCD Type 2 Logic**: The `dim_customer` model includes logic for SCD Type 2, with columns for `effective_from`, `effective_to`, and `is_current`.

3. **Configuration and Documentation**: dbt configurations and documentation are added for each model and source. This includes descriptions and column-level metadata.

4. **Connection and Source Configuration**: The source configuration is adapted for dbt using the `sources.yml` file, which specifies the database and schema.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**: dbt inherently provides error handling and logging through its run commands and logs.

6. **Best Practices**: The use of CTEs, Jinja templating, and dbt's configuration options align with modern dbt practices.

7. **Assumptions**: It is assumed that the `CRMDB` database and `CRM` schema are accessible and correctly configured in the dbt profile.
